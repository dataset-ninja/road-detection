**Road Detection and Centerline Extraction Dataset** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the geospatial domain. 

The dataset consists of 224 images with 448 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *centerline* and *road*.

Images in the Road Detection and Centerline Extraction dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (160 images), *test* (44 images), and *validation* (20 images). The dataset was released in 2017 by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
